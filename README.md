## 🚀 About Me

I’m Adeiza — a **full-stack developer** with a deep focus on backend engineering. I build, test, ship, and optimize software that works.  
Currently pushing limits with **Node.js**, **Express**, and real-world backend architectures.  

I believe in *project-first learning* and use every project as a way to sharpen my problem-solving skills. I don't just write code — I **engineer** solutions.

## 🧠 What I’m Doing Now

- 🎯 Building **SkillReformNG**, a platform that connects users with verified training opportunities (admin, trainer, trainee roles).
- 🛠️ Developing clean REST APIs with role-based auth, slugs, email verification, and dashboard logic.
- 💡 Designing and prototyping future SaaS ideas involving AI, education, and accessibility.
- 📚 Mastering core backend concepts: **sessions, tokens, role-based access, security, database design**.
