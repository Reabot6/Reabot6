## üöÄ About Me

I‚Äôm a seasoned full-stack developer with over five years of experience, specializing in backend development and system architecture. My expertise lies in designing and building scalable, secure, and high-performance APIs using **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, with a focus on authentication systems, database optimization, and microservices. I thrive on diving deep into complex systems, architecting robust solutions, and ensuring seamless functionality under the hood.

On the frontend, I leverage modern frameworks like **React** and **TailwindCSS** to deliver responsive, user-centric interfaces. My recent completion of **Harvard's CS50** has deepened my understanding of computer science fundamentals‚Äîfrom algorithms and data structures to low-level programming in **C++**‚Äîenabling me to approach problems with both theoretical rigor and practical expertise. I‚Äôm proficient in containerization with **Docker**, ensuring consistent deployment pipelines and scalable infrastructure.

Currently, I‚Äôm focused on leading innovative projects, mentoring junior developers, and exploring advanced topics like distributed systems, AI-driven SaaS, and cloud-native architectures. I‚Äôm seeking senior-level opportunities to architect impactful solutions, drive technical strategy, and collaborate with dynamic teams.

üß† **What I‚Äôm Doing Now**

- Architecting **SkillReformNG**, a platform connecting users to verified training opportunities with role-based authentication, dynamic dashboards, and scalable infrastructure.
- Designing clean, secure REST APIs with features like JWT-based auth, slugified URLs, email verification, and real-time analytics.
- Prototyping SaaS solutions in AI, education, and accessibility, leveraging cloud services and microservices.
- Deepening expertise in containerization with **Docker** and Kubernetes for streamlined CI/CD pipelines.
- Experimenting with **C++** for performance-critical applications and systems programming.
- Participating in hackathons and open-source bounties to rapidly prototype and validate ideas.
